ans=> No output (Infinite loop / Crash)
Explanation.
• The for loop never stops because i > 0 is always true.
• JavaScript uses floating-point numbers, so there is no integer overflow like in Java (byte).
• Unlike Java, where byte wraps around after 127, JavaScript numbers keep growing indefinitely.
• This results in an infinite loop, causing a crash or unresponsive script.
