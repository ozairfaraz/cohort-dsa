Explanation. 
• The loop starts at i = 2 and increases by 3 each iteration (i += 3).
• The loop condition is i <= 20, so we track the values of i:
• Iteration	i Value	count Value
      1st	              2	        1
      2nd	              5	        2
      3rd	              8	        3
      4th	             11	        4
      5th	             14	        5
      6th	             17	        6
      7th	             20	        7
• The loop stops when i becomes 23 (greater than 20).
• Total iterations = 7
