ans=> 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation. 
• The loop does not initialize i inside the for loop, but it starts from i = 0.
• i++ inside the loop increments i before logging.
• Iterations:
      i = 1 → Print 1 
      i = 2 → Print 2
      i = 3 → Print 3
      i = 4 → Print 4
      i = 5 → Print 5 and then exits.
